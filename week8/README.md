# Fitbit Consumer Behavior Analysis - Capstone Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Fitbit Consumer Behavior Analysis Capstone Project! As a data analyst at our company, your task is to leverage data science techniques to analyze and derive insights from Fitbit user behavior. This project aims to uncover patterns, trends, and valuable information that can inform business decisions related to product development, marketing strategies, and user engagement.

## Project Title

**Fitbit Consumer Behavior Analysis**

## Project Description

Fitbit is a widely used fitness and health tracking device that collects a plethora of data related to users' physical activity, sleep patterns, and more. In this capstone project, we seek to analyze Fitbit user data to gain a deeper understanding of consumer behavior. The goal is to extract actionable insights that can guide product enhancements, targeted marketing campaigns, and user engagement strategies.

## Project Features

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Cleanse and preprocess raw Fitbit data to ensure accuracy and reliability in analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct EDA to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies in user behavior data.

3. **User Segmentation:** Segment users based on various characteristics such as activity levels, sleep patterns, and usage frequency.

4. **Predictive Modeling:** Develop predictive models to forecast user engagement or identify potential product features that could improve user satisfaction.

5. **Data Visualization:** Create visually appealing charts and graphs to present key findings and insights to stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Database:** SQLite (or any other database used for storage)
- **Visualization Tools:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd [project-directory]

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Run `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the Fitbit data.
2. **EDA:** Execute `02_eda.ipynb` for exploratory data analysis.
3. **User Segmentation:** Use `03_user_segmentation.ipynb` for segmenting Fitbit users.
4. **Predictive Modeling:** Run `04_predictive_modeling.ipynb` for building and evaluating predictive models.

## Testing

No specific testing instructions are provided as this project focuses more on data analysis rather than software development. However, thorough validation of data cleaning and preprocessing steps is essential.
