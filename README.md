# Frog-and-Leap-game-in-python
Frog and Toad is a curious race game for 3-6 players. The players control froads (or is that togs?), creatures which are never quite sure whether they are hopping frogs or walking toads. The froads need to escape from their current environment which they do by racing down two spiraling roads to the exits, collecting bonus tokens on the way.

In each round of the game players first select the actions their froads will take from a shopping list of available actions. Then they move their froads. Depending on the situation, players will find that some actions are better than others, but each action may only be selected once in a round, so players scramble to select what they think will be their best actions, whilst second guessing what the other players will do.

Some actions that players may select change the settings of the game â€“ who selects first and moves first, and what the criterion is for earning bonus move tokens. Other actions move your froads with hops or walks, forwards or backwards (going backwards allows you to pick up bonus move tokens). There are even actions that cause both of your froads to move.

There are effectively two separate races, and the winner of the game is the first player to get both of his froads to the end of their roads.
